Initialising a repository will add the .git and it will keep track of the changes

staging area is a step before we try to commit. We could review our contents to be commited in the staging area

once you start finding the bug by entering into the previous commits. Your head will be in detached state. After finding it out 
git checkout master
Then you are on the latest commit, then you fix the bug and commit it.

Branches
To check the branches present type
git branch

To jump to a certain branch say "ks"
git checkout ks
And create the commits there  and the experiments

Merging two branches
Two branches can be merged with the following command. Say merging the new commits from "ks" to "master"
git merge master ks

While merging git adds the line which were not there in the parent file.
